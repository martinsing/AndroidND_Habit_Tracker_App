#Build Your Project
For this project, youâ€™ll be setting up and using the database schema for a simple habit tracking app. _This project will not have any UI components;_ instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.

First, define and setup up the database schema (i.e. table and columns) that can be used to help a user keep track of their habits (e.g. walking the dog, practicing the saxophone, taking any medications). Then, create 2 methods that insert and read data to/from your database. These 2 methods can all be contained in a single Java file.

Your project will be evaluated using the Habit Tracker project rubric.

##Additional Criteria
The intent of this project is to give you practice writing raw Java code using the necessary classes provided by the Android framework; therefore, the use of external libraries will not be permitted to complete this project.
