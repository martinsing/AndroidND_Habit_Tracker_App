#Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You'll be setting up and using the database schema for a simple habit tracking app.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a **Habit Tracking app** which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. This project will not have any UI components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.

##Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned about data storage in a SQLite database on Android. This is critical if you want to make any app that persists a user’s data over time or syncs with an online database for offline use.

##What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Creating a SQLite table in your app
- Populating that table with new entries
- Modifying the entries
- Displaying the contents of the table to users.
